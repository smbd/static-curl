[![Build Status](https://ci.moparisthe.best/job/moparisthebest/job/static-curl/job/master/badge/icon%3Fstyle=plastic)](https://ci.moparisthe.best/job/moparisthebest/job/static-curl/job/master/)

These are a couple simple scripts to build a fully static curl binary using alpine linux docker containers.  Currently it is a featureful build with OpenSSL, libssh2, nghttp2, and zlib, supporting most protocols.  Tweak configure options in [build.sh](build.sh#L50) if you need something else (and/or suggest or PR).
